1. While an object stops due to friction, it first stops moving linearly and later stops rotating; this is because the    opposing energy required to stop an object from moving forward is lesser than the energy required in stopping an object    from rotating. Opposing forces required to stop an object from moving forward are friction and air resistance, but the    forces involved in stopping an object from rotating is only friction and air resistance is infinitesimally small. Also,    the frictional force required is higher in case of rotation of a rigid body.
